                            "Sex on Fire" is the first single released from American alternative rock band Kings of Leon's fourth studio album Only by the Night. The song gave Kings of Leon their first number-one single in Australia, Finland, Ireland and the United Kingdom, charting
                            at the top spot on digital downloads alone in the latter country, before its physical release. In September 2009 it was Britain's second most-downloaded digital single ever.[1] The song has sold 1.2 million copies in the United
                            Kingdom as of November 2012.[2] It has also gained significant popularity in the band's native United States, reaching number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 56 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it their second
                            highest charting song in their homeland on the former chart. In 2008, the song earned the band their first Grammy nominations. The song was nominated for Best Rock Song,[citation needed] and won the award for Best Rock Vocal
                            Performance by a Duo or Group.[3] In addition, the album earned a nomination for Best Rock Album. Channel V Australia named the song as the third biggest hit of 2008. It was voted number one in Triple J Hottest 100 countdown
                            for 2008. Following the success of the follow-up single "Use Somebody" in the United States on pop radio, the track was re-serviced[4] to US pop radio in November. Remixes of both songs were used for the runway soundtrack in
                            the 2009 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. The song was written about lead singer Caleb's then-girlfriend (and now-wife), model Lily Aldridge.[

                            "Pyro" is a song by American rock band Kings of Leon, and is the second single that was released from their 2010 album Come Around Sundown. It is the third track on the album.[1] The song, along with its accompanying music video, premiered on December
                            9 on the Kings' website and on their YouTube channel. According to songfacts.com, Caleb Followill explained about the original inspiration for this song: "I had actually written some verses because I was watching this piece
                            on these radical Christians that live up in the mountains and somehow the FBI got involved and pretty much went and killed them [presumably a reference to Ruby Ridge]. And so I started writing kind of about that and about a
                            guy that was kind of fed up with it all and he thought that the world that he was living in wasn't the perfect world to him so he kind of goes and burns it down. It's just one of those songs where it's like it starts out with
                            someone thinking they know how it's supposed to be and at the end it's like, 'I can't even be that way.'"

                            "Supersoaker" is a song by American rock band Kings of Leon. The song was written by Caleb Followill, Nathan Followill, Jared Followill, and Matthew Followill and produced by Angelo Petraglia. It was released on July 17, 2013 as the lead single from their
                            sixth studio album Mechanical Bull (2013), and peaked at number 32 on the UK Singles Chart. On September 24, 2013, Kings of Leon performed "Supersoaker" on ABC's morning show Good Morning America. The music video for the song was directed by W.I.Z..[1] The clip, which shows a love story set in the 1950s,[2] was described by W.I.Z. as "an imagined hybrid of pop-art screenprint, hand tinting and Technicolour film". W.I.Z. also explained that "[We wanted] playful, sensual ideas of teen angst, rock and roll and Americana; we wanted to a make a piece that was urgent as well as effortless, precision with abandon"
